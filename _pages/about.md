Hi!

I am Korinna Lindemann, a PhD Candidate at the DFG-funded Research Training Group DYNAMICS and the Hertie School, Berlin. 

My dissertation revolves around the question of the political behaviour of immigrants in the arrival country. I am specifically focusing on electoral behaviour and political attitudes. My research interests include topics on migration, political behaviour and quantitative methods. 

Prior to moving to Berlin, I completed my BA and MA both at the University of Zurich. In my bachelors, I majored in Communication and Media Studies and minored in Political Science. In Political Science masters, I focused on Democracy, Development and International Relations, as well as Political Data Journalism. I also was a visiting student at the University of Warsaw. During my masters I worked, inter alia, as a student assistant at the Democracy Barometer, was a tutor for applied quantitative methods and completed a research internship at the Chair of Political Methodology at the Department of Political Science.

For any questions, collaboration or other inquiries (e.g. you cannot access a publication), feel free to get in touch!
